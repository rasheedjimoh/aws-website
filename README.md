## Why We Need It

The need for a reliable web hosting infrastructure cannot be overstated in the digital age. Whether for business websites, e-commerce platforms, or personal blogs, a robust hosting setup ensures optimal performance, scalability, and security. By utilizing AWS services, we can achieve these objectives while benefiting from the scalability and flexibility of cloud computing. From domain registration to SSL certificate management and content delivery network (CDN) deployment, each step contributes to a resilient and efficient web hosting solution.

## Technology Stack

1. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):** S3 is a highly scalable object storage service offered by AWS. It provides secure, durable, and highly available storage for websites, applications, and data backups. In our setup, we use S3 buckets to host website pages, ensuring reliable content delivery to end-users.

2. **Amazon Route 53:** Route 53 is a scalable domain name system (DNS) web service provided by AWS. It enables domain registration and routing of internet traffic to the appropriate resources, such as S3 buckets or EC2 instances. By configuring Route 53, we establish a link between our domain name and the hosted website, supporting both www and non-www URLs.

3. **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):** ACM is a service that simplifies the process of deploying SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication over HTTPS. By requesting a public certificate through ACM, we ensure encrypted connections between users and our website, enhancing data security and user trust.

4. **Amazon CloudFront:** CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) service offered by AWS. It accelerates the delivery of web content to users by caching static and dynamic content at edge locations worldwide. By deploying CloudFront distributions, we enhance website performance, reduce latency, and secure the website with HTTPS encryption.

## Process/Procedure

1. **Domain Registration:** Purchase a domain name on AWS and create a hosted zone to manage DNS records.

2. **S3 Bucket Setup:** Create S3 buckets to host website pages, configure access policies, and set up redirection buckets for internet traffic.

3. **Route 53 Configuration:** Link the domain name to the website by configuring Route 53, supporting both www and non-www URLs.

4. **SSL Certificate Deployment:** Request a public SSL certificate through ACM to enable secure HTTPS connections for the website.

5. **CloudFront Distribution:** Create CloudFront distributions to secure the website with HTTPS and optimize content delivery through the global CDN.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the deployment of an AWS-based web hosting infrastructure offers unparalleled benefits in terms of scalability, security, and performance. By leveraging services such as S3, Route 53, Certificate Manager, and CloudFront, we ensure a reliable and secure hosting environment for websites and applications. This portfolio highlights the importance of cloud-based solutions in meeting the demands of modern web hosting, empowering businesses and individuals to establish a strong online presence with confidence and efficiency.
